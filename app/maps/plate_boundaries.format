Subject: Plate boundaries
Status: R

Following is a file in UNIX "compress" format of the University of Texas plate
boundary digitizations.  They say this about the file
        EXPLANATION FOR POMP BOUNDARY FILE bound.90

Source: Paleo-Oceanographic Mapping Project (University
        of Texas at Austin)
Data Manager: Lisa Gahagan, (512) 471-0488

Each boundary has a 2 line header, followed by a string of lats, longs,
and pen movements (2 = pen down, or connect to previous point, 3 = pen up,
or start a new line segment).  A lat, long of 99.000, 99.000 signifies
the end of the string for that boundary.  

HEADER LINE 1:
        Reference number for location and source (see file ref.lis)
        Plate boundary number
        Name of boundary

HEADER LINE 2:
        Reference number for plate
        Time of appearance (mya)
        Time of disappearance (mya)* 
        Boundary Type Code:
                FZ = fracture zone
                RI = ridge
                SS = strike-slip
                TF = transform fault
                TR = trench
                etc. (see file ref.lis)
        Magnetic anomaly code*
        Plate code*
        Color code for plotting*
        
* signifies these codes are inappropriate for this data set (POMP
maintains other files of past isochrons in this format)
