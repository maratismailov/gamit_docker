                      Release Notes for GAMIT/GLOBK 10.71

                              Monday 9 March 2020

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 10.71 consolidates incremental updates made since release 10.70 of June
2018 and completes modifications to GAMIT following recommendations for the
IGS's repro3. Significant changes of which most users should be aware are:

- The radiation pressure model is expanded from 9 to 13 parameters, adding two
  twice-per-revolution (2/rev) and two 4/rev terms. GAMIT will carry all 13
  parameters, designated "ECOMC" (for Empirical CODE Models 1 and 2 combined) in
  tables/sestbl. In generating fits to the IGS orbits, we recommend using ECOMC
  (the default). Note that if you estimate orbits in GAMIT ("RELAX." in
  tables/sestbl.) you cannot mix in GLOBK the 10.71 processing with pre-10.71
  processing that uses the 9-parameter (BERNE or ECOM1) models. When combining
  regional processing with MIT or SIO global h-files, you should always run
  GAMIT without orbit estimation ("BASELINE" in tables/sestbl.), as we have long
  recommended. Even with the same version, different choices of orbit modeling
  parameters are likely to make the MIT combined binary-files incompatible with
  recently processed. If BASELINE model is used in the GAMIT processing, the
  incompatibilities will be minor but in RELAX mode they can be severe (high
  chi^2 increments). Removing all "apr_svs", "mar_svs", "apr_rad" and "mar_rad"
  options in the GLOBK command file should minimize the effects of
  incompatibilities.

- Beidou processing now uses L6/C6 (B3 at 1268.53 MHz) rather than L7/C7 (B2b at
  1207.140 MHz) as the lower-frequency observable to accommodate the tracking
  configuration of most of the current GNSS receivers providing public data.
  Based on a sampling of 230 RINEX files from the archives, about 50% include
  only L6/C6 compared with about 5% that include only L7/C7. The higher-
  frequency observable will remain L2/C2 (B1-2 at 1561.098 MHz) since very few
  of the public RINEX files contain L1/C1 from the B1 at 1575.42 MHz transmitted
  by BDS 3 satellites. If L7/C7 is the only observable present (i.e., no L6/C6),
  GAMIT will try to process the data along with L7/C7 receivers but there may be
  ambiguity resolution issues. Users should assess data files and process
  together only those sites with the same frequency data. There are still some
  issues with clock estimates for Beidou data and pre-fit editing in autcln.

- The default tables/sestbl. now has the 2nd-order ionosphere model turned on.
  The IGSG IONEX files will be used by default. If processing near-real time,
  the "-ion igrg" option should be used with sh_gamit. We also recommend always
  including the "Inertial Reference System" option (current default "IAU0A")
  explicitly.
  
- tables/svnav.dat is now linked to the IGS satellite metadata SINEX file
  (igs_metadata.snx). Release 10.70 and earlier versions of GAMIT cannot read
  this file format and svnav.dat needs to be linked to svanv.dat.allgnss, which
  will be maintained for the foreseeable future. Several changes to files in the
  tables/ directory may be incompatible with early versions of GAMIT.

- The tables/station.info file now accommodates another optional column
  ("AntDAZ" in the header line) to specify the azimuth (clockwise from true
  north) of the antenna. Conventionally antennas are aligned with true north but
  some (and likely many others that we don't know about yet) are recorded as set
  to another azimuth. The "AntDAZ" azimuth is read to rotate the phase center
  offsets (PCOs) and phase center variations (PCVs) from the ANTEX file
  (tables/antmod.dat) to correct for the azimuth of the antenna. sh_upd_stnfo
  can extract this information from IGS log files if the AntDAZ header is
  included (users should ensure that there are no non-numeric values in the
  columns below AntDAZ; white space in OK). The IGS will not implement this
  feature until ITRF2020 is released (that is, it will be part of repro3 but not
  the operational processing).

- We have changed many symbolic links in tables/ to be relative, rather than
  absolute, which assume that users install a local GRIDS/ directory at the same
  level as the source code (e.g. gamit/, libraries/, kf/, maps/, tables/, etc.),
  where grids downloaded from ftp://everest.mit.edu/pub/GRIDS/ should be stored.
  Creation of specific symbolic links, e.g. atml.grid, map.grid, met.grid, by
  the user to the corresponding grid files is then no longer necessary.

- sh_gamit now will remake g-files from SP3 files each time it is run to ensure
  that the orbit models in tables/sestbl. are consistent with the sh_sp3fit
  models (these models are now read from sestbl. provided a copy can be found in
  the standard processing directories). For sub-network processing, g-files
  should be made once before proceeding to process each sub-network (assumed to
  be in parallel) using the "-remakeg N" option used with sh_gamit.

- We remind users that when processing GLONASS data the ambiguity free (.glr) 
  binary h-files should be used in GLOBK. Also remember that a multi-GNSS orbit
  file should be used as well.

- The format for the "apr_svs" and "mar_svs" radiation parameters specification
  in the GLOBK command file has changed, with the unused "zrad" and "xrad"
  entries removed (see Pre 5.32 and Post 5.32 discussion in help/globk.hlp). The
  options using the "<nn.nn>R" format remains unchanged. Older globk commands
  with explicit radiation parameter constraints and process noise may need to be
  updated.

- GLOBK has moved to using "<GNSS><SVN>_<PRN>" syntax for satellite identifiers
  in output files (e.g. the .org-file), where <GNSS> is G, R, E or C, and SVN
  and PRN are Satellite Vehicle Number and Pseudo-Random Noise code,
  respectively. For GPS, the default is still PRN<PRN>_<SVN>. The new format for
  GPS can be invoked with the "use_prn n" command near the top of the command
  file. (See help/globk.hlp.)

- New wild card features in file names now allow dates and times to be used
  based on the date and time of the h-file being processed. (See 5.32 features
  in help/globk.hlp.)

- GLOBK can now do reference frame realization in back solutions. This will
  happen automatically if GLORG is invoked in a GLOBK command file with the
  "bak_file" option included.

- We will no longer provide GMT .grd-files in the maps/ directory to reduce the
  size of the archive (.tar) files. Instead we now provide a new script,
  sh_dem, which will download and create a local copy of a chosen digital
  elevation model (DEM) over a geographic region, both selected using the script
  options. The script is now called by sh_plotvel if the "-topo", "-topo_file"
  and/or "-illu_file" options are used; if the latter is given without an
  argument, sh_plotvel will create a .grd-file of the gradient for plotting
  shaded-relief (illumination) from the topographic .grd-file named or created
  with the "-topo_file" option. Both sh_dem and sh_plotvel require GMT to run.

- GMT version 6.0.0 was released in November 2019. Scripts in com/ that use GMT
  to produce plots were updated for GAMIT/GLOBK 10.6 to accommodate major
  changes in the syntax of GMT version 5 commands (see relnote.10.6); the old
  scripts, using GMT 4 syntax, are still available in com_preGMT5/ but are no
  longer maintained. Although we have not done extensive testing yet, we
  understand that GMT 6 is fully backwards compatible with GMT 5 (e.g.
  https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.0/migrating.html) and should work
  seamlessly with our scripts currently in com/, which explicitly call "gmt"
  (now the sole GMT executable) throughout.

- We have become aware that the GMT installation available via the software
  repository for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS does not include the supplemental programs,
  most significantly psvelo for GAMIT/GLOBK. We recommend upgrading your
  Ubuntu operating system or building GMT from source. See
  https://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/wiki/Installing#Linux and our "Known
  Issues" web page at http://geoweb.mit.edu/gg/issues.php for more information.

- We have also become aware that there seems to be an issue with the
  implementation of gfortran version 7 on at least Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and openSUSE
  Leap 15.1 operating systems, resulting in failed compilation with segmentation
  fault error messages, including "See <file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-7/README.Bugs>
  for instructions." We recommend upgrading to another version of gcc/gfortan,
  or downgrading to gcc/gfortran version 6. See our "Known Issues" web page at
  http://geoweb.mit.edu/gg/issues.php for more information.

Summary of specific changes for 10.71 (by directory):

- com/

links.arc, links.com, links.day: Updated to link otides.dat and to avoid linking
                                 the old ephemeris files (soltab., luntab.,
                                 nutabl.) if ~/gg/tables/nbody exists. Fixed
                                 typos.

sh_cleanup: Added missing closing curly bracket in test to remove n-files on
            lines 386 and 387. Floyd/Pickle 190507

sh_gamit: Revert to using GPS-only RINEX 2 instead of MGEX RINEX 3 nav files
          when processing GPS data since sh_rx2apr (svpos/svdiff) doesn't yet
          recognize RINEX 3.
          Fix bug in naming files for -jclock sp3 option.
          Fixed a typo in call to sh_setup causing the lfile not to be updated
          from the .apr-file.
          Correct version number - now 10.70 2019/8/14.

sh_get_orbits: Placed $noclean variable in quotes in if-test at end to ensure a
               string match rather than interpretation as a test, which causes
               an error.

sh_glred: Removed debug statement that forced archiving of the binary h-files.

sh_hector: Minor edits to some awk commands.

sh_makex: Initialize the sp3file variable to avoid a problem when running stand-
          alone.

sh_otlcmc: New script to create tables/otlcmc.dat file from .cmc-files at
           http://holt.oso.chalmers.se/loading/CMC/.

sh_plot_elmean: Updated color scheme to work with GMT 5. Small changes to line
                widths.

sh_rx2apr: Updated grep commands to select only records that begin with a space
           before the site ID, ignoring any "EXTENDED" records that may be in
           the .apr file.

sh_sp3fit: Fix bug in writing model names for the ARC input file.

sh_tshist: Updated script to fully implement pos_res type. Original only
           partially updated from com_pre5GMT version.

sh_upd_stnfo (and kf/htoglb/mstinf.[fh]): Added -debug option to help diagnose
                                          problems with bad year in IGS logfiles
                                          and fixed a bug associated with first
                                          antenna starting after the first
                                          receiver entry.

sh_update_dcb: Added explicit internal test for presence of tables/svnav.dat,
               needed for gamit/utils/dcbtab2.

sh_update_eop: Updated to circumvent the shutdown of maia.usno.navy.mil and
               toshi.nofs.navy.mil from 2019-10-24 to 2020-04-30.

                                rrinex.f and "MAXOBT" in makex.h to 63, to
                                accommodate long records in RINEX 3 files.

lib/clkera: Erroneous extra read of "clkoff", apparently a problem with Intel
            compiler but not gfortran.

                          satellite number is assigned to the new PRN03.

gen_util/real_stats.f: Updated dimensioning and bounds checking. Very long time
                       series could cause segmentation violations.

                                           logfiles and fixed a bug associated
                                           with first antenna starting after the
                                           first receiver entry.

track, gen_util/sp3_lib.f: Updated for Beidou B7 phase and range measurements.

utils/corcom: Updated output formats to allow for fast ice velocities.

utils/glbtog.[fh]: Fixed bugs with writing G-files for non-GPS systems.

libraries/

comlib/proper_runst.f: Removed need for trailing "/" in HELP_DIR definition.

- tables/

luntab.2020.J2000, soltab.2020.J2000, nutabl.2020: Added luni-solar tables for
                                                   2020 from JPL DE200.

antmod.dat: Now linked to an IGS14 rather than IGS08 ANTEX file, which is no
            longer updated by the IGS for new launches. As noted in
            relnote.10.61, this will create a 2-3 mm discontinuity in height for
            all antennas and 5-10 mm discontinuities in horizontal and height
            for about 20 antennas.
            Updated regularly to the latest IGS14 ANTEX file (currently
            igs14_2091.atx, as of the date of this release). Linked from
            2019-10-10 (GPS week 2074) onwards to the IGS14 ANTEX file
            supplemented with calibrations provided by the National Geodetic
            Survey (NGS) (currently ngs14_2091.atx), plus some additional
            entries copied from similar records to accommodate antennas without
            any official calibrations. tables/antmod.dat is linked to
            tables/ngs14_2091_plus.atx, at the time of this release.
            Updated GLONASS SVs R801, R802, R855, R856, R858 and R859 to match
            extended IGS designations (K1A, K1B and M+) in
            tables/igs_metadata.snx.

igs14_comb_na17.apr: Added new North America plate reference frame ("NA17")
                     based on Kreemer et al. (2018).

ftp_info: Updated vmf1 address and directory according to change reported by
          Johannes Boehm in IGS-ACS email #1176.
          Added HartRAO IGS regional data center and JAXA data center.

globk.cmd: Added inclusion of apr_tran by default and option for apr_rot when
           using SINEX files.
           Corrected erroneous "COMB out_glb" output file name to ensure
           "------" string is parsed properly by prepending "H" to file name.

leap.sec: Extended limit of table to 31 December 2020 with no additional leap
          seconds, following to IERS Bulletin C 59.

hi.dat: Added TRM159800.00 antenna.

igs_metadata.snx: Added from http://mgex.igs.org/ (currently
                  igs_metadata_2091.snx, as of the date of this release) and
                  augmented with a bespoke block for the yaw of each satellite,
                  currently read from tables/svnav.dat with some assumptions for
                  some satellites and systems.

rcvant.dat: Fully updated to match IGS codes for all receivers and antennas,
            following ftp://igs.org/pub/station/general/rcvr_ant.tab. Records of
            other known antennas, from the old rcvant.dat and those in the NGS
            ANTEX file (see description of antmod.dat, above), are added. The
            14th character, indicating support for the receiver or antenna in
            GAMIT, is updated to identify the source of antenna calibration. See
            header for more information.

svnav.dat: Metadata for GLONASS (R), Galileo (E), Beidou (C), IRNSS (I) and QZSS
           (J) fully updated to match tables/igs_metadata.snx (from
           http://mgex.igs.org/), which will ultimately supercede
           tables/svnav.dat; metadata for GPS assumed to be good (will be
           verified ultimately).

otlcmc.dat: Replaced the provisional center-of-mass corrections for FES2012 with
            new official ones from H. G. Scherneck. The differences are less
            than 0.05 mm.
