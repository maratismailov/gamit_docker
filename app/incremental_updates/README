Summary features added 17-May-21:
 
New version (5.21) of glorg which has added option to modify station coordinate 
covariances to account for the number of times stations are used in multiple 
analysis center combinations on daily solutions.  Feature invoked with
"org_opt BALN". 
 
kf/includes/kalman_param.h: Added documentation for new version of glorg.
  TAH 20210517
 
com/sh_dem: Updated URLs for downloading SRTM30 (version 2.1), and SRTM3 and
  SRTM1 (version 3); SRTM3 and SRTM1 version 2.1 seems no longer available.
  These new URLs require a NASA Earthdata login in a ~/.netrc file, exactly the
  same as sh_get_rinex, sh_get_nav, sh_cddis (called by sh_get_orbits),
  sh_get_ion, sh_get_met, sh_update_eop, sh_get_ultrarapids and sh_sel_rinex
  (see 2020-08-31 record, and 2020-09-04, 2020-09-17, 2020-09-20 and 2020-10-21
  updates for details). MAF 20210513

kf/glorg/Makefile.generic: Added balance_cov.f to glorg library. TAH 20210510
 
kf/glorg/balance_cov.f: New routine added to glorg to account for multiple uses 
  of stations when combinations from multiple analysis centers (ACs) on one day 
  are made (IGS type-combined solutions). Satellite PCO estimates are also 
  modified by number of ACs in combination. TAH 20210509
 
kf/glout/write_glb_he.f: Modified to add line if BALN option has been used.
  TAH 20210509
 
kf/globk/decode_prt.f: Added new option BALN to balance networks so that
  stations used multiple times do not have their standard deviations reduced by
  sqrt(N). The operation is only done in the output stage of glorg. If the
  "out_sol" command is used in glorg to outout the combined binary h-file (.CON
  extent), the balancing operation has been performed. (Standard "out_glb"
  binary h-files from globk is not effected). When using the .CON h-files,
  "apr_rot" should be used to allow rotation of the frame resolved H-file.
  These .CON files also have the translations resolved. If converted to SINEX,
  the -d=TR can be used to add back rotation and translation uncertainty. Scale
  should not be estimated when frame resolved H-files are produced because the
  scale will be fixed at the reference frame values in these files. TAH 20210509

CRITICAL UPDATE: Access to the CDDIS global data archive via anonymous FTP was
discontinued after 31 October 2020. CDDIS now needs to be accessed via
authenticated secure HTTP or anonymous secure FTP. We have updated the following
eight scripts to accommodate this change (see 2020-08-31 record, and 2020-09-04,
2020-09-17, 2020-09-20 and 2020-10-21 updates, below): sh_get_rinex, sh_get_nav,
sh_cddis (called by sh_get_orbits), sh_get_ion, sh_get_met, sh_update_eop,
sh_get_ultrarapids and sh_sel_rinex. Each of these updated scripts must be
downloaded to your ~/gg/com/ directory to continue to access the CDDIS archive.
  We recommend that you register to use authenticated secure HTTP by creating an
Earthdata account at https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/. Then you must include this
information in a ".netrc" file (note the dot at the beginning of the file name)
in your home directory with the following line:
machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov login <username> password <password>
where <username> is your Earthdata username and <password> is your Earthdata
password (do not use quotation marks around your <username> or <password> in
this line in .netrc). If you do not wish to create an Earthdata account, you may
still access the CDDIS archive via anonymous secure FTP but this requires your
system to have curl version >= 7.11.0 or wget version >= 1.18.
  See https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/CDDIS_Archive_Access.html
for more information.

  command to allow solid-Earth tide model to be specified (IERS2010 or default
  analytic model) and to turn off model completely (NOETIDE). NOBLQ needs to be
  given as argument to turn off ocean-tide model (structured this way for
  backwards compatibility). TAH 20200520

com/sh_preproc: Added -lfreq option (see sh_makexp). Fixed bug with g-file being
  checked with "^G" rather than "^$gnss". TAH 20200511

com/sh_gamit: Added -lfreq option (see sh_makexp); -remakex Y will be needed if
  older x-files already exist in processing directory. TAH 20200511

  could have errors of a day near the end of the year and assign values to the
  wrong year. TAH 20200424

tables/svs_exclude.dat.nanu: Updated following USCG NANU 2020017. MAF 20200424

com/sh_network_sel: Added a secondary list of stations so that the core list can

  igs_metadata_2101_plus.snx, and linked igs_metadata.snx to
  igs_metadata_2101_plus.snx; updated svnav.dat.allgnss following
  igs_metadata_2101.snx. MAF 20200416

gamit/orbits/yawtab.f: Added one day to date for call to svnav_read because the
  start of the t-file may occur before the start time of a PRN number record.
  A. Koulali/R. Pickle/MAF 20200414

com/{sh_dem,sh_plotvel}: Updated to write new .grd-files to current working
  directory, rather than ~/gg/maps/; corrected definition of maximum longitude
  in "minmax" variable when passing topo_file name from sh_dem to grdimage for
