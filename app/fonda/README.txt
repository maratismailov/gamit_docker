This is version 1.3 of FONDA, including MAKED and SOLVEM plus other utilities.

This software is still beta, so tread carefully! Version 1.3 includes numerous
bug fixes to the previous version. MAKED changes centre around the NEWBB format. A new SINEX
import module has also been added. SOLVEM changes are more wide ranging. See the 
museum.f file for details of changes.

The manual has been significantly reorganised in this release. Hopefully you will find
it easier to read than the previous attempt. No doubt there are still significant 
improvements/corrections that are required.

Also included is an archive supplied by Kurt Feigl (solvem.fg.tar.Z) which contains several routines
for plotting of SOLVEM output using GMT. Other than these routines, this archive contains 
a previous version of SOLVEM, so be sure to not overwrite the 1.3 directory. I have been 
unsuccesful in using these routines! If you get them working, then please supply the '
code to MIT to be included in future updates.
