#2 Deriving solution package: (SOLVEM)
     This package allows us to combine the modern space deodesy data with
historical geodetic survey data to get the network deformation estimate.
We will use current GLOBAK algorithm to construct the solving frame.
There are several differences should be pointed out:
     (a) SOLVEM uses simplified input, that means we only need input the
station coordinates (possible velocity), baseline length or azimuth angle
and their covariance matrix.  We don't need consider other parameters
such as orbits, earth rotation, atmosphere and ionosphere.
     (b) SOLVEM tries to extend the current reference frame to the past
under the assumption: for a short interval, say 100 years, the extra-
polation still gives us a reasonable constraint.(cosidering additional
displacement from other sources such as earthquake etc.)
     (c) SOLVEM keeps the conventional regular solution (fix one station
and one azimuth in 2D case); general inverse solution (minimum norm
solution); inner coordinate solution and outer coordinate solution.  And
SOLVEM will concentrate in model constraint solution.
     (d) We will develop 2D algorithm first and extend it to 3D case
later.
     (e) SOLVEM should allow multi-stage input files.  That means 
         (e.1) input original observables to estimate displacement and
               strain rate.
         (e.2) input displacement to estimate strain rate.
         (e.3) input priori values and covariance matrix to test various
               constraint solutions. 
    1. input file (solvem.in):
         (1) number of networks (loop over the number)
         (2) epoch, type of data, site number, baseline(or angle) number
             (loop over baselines or other observables)

             (3.2) inner coordinate solution
                   (3.2.1) minimum norm inverse
                   (3.2.2) part of sites are exempted from the minimi-
                           zation
                           specify these sites
             (3.3) outer coordinate solution
                   minimize the displacement normal to a direction
                   specify this direction
             (3.4) model constraint solution
                   specify the model

                   others
             (4.2) rotation model
                   no rotation
                   block rotation (specify relevent parameters)
         (5) output option
             (5.1) terse or verbose
             (5.2) single solution or multi solutions
             (5.3) residuals file
             (5.4) plot file (yes or no)
    2. algorithm
         (1) Kalman filter or sequential least square
         (2) compare with direct least square
         (3) assume the normal matrix is positive defined (remove the
             rank deficiency), using Cholescky decomposition
         (4) consider outlier checking
         (5) weighting
             (5.1) by reciprocal square standard deviation
             (5.2) by error model: sigma**2=a**2+(b*l)**2
             (5.3) by specified weight

#3 Diagnosis package: (DIAGNO)
     Residual analysis is an inportant ring of the whole chain.  The 
main theoretical discussion can be found in Segal & Mattews' paper:
"Displacement calculations from geodetic data and the testing of
geophysical deformation models", J.G.R., 14954-14966, 1988
     1. residual checking
        see if there is systematic pattern left.
     2. hypothesis testing
        suppose n is the observation dimension
                p is the model dimention 
                q is the rank dificiency of A
                r(a) is the model independent "pure error"
                r(l) is the "lack of fit"
        then we have the relation:
        P(n,p,q)=[|r(l)**2|/(p-q)]/[|r(a)**2|/(n-p)] = F(p-q,n-p)
        We using F-test to decide whether the model is acceptable
        under the confidence level (1-alfa)
     3. model comparison

#4 Forward modeling package: (FMODEL)
     Actually, FONDA is an iterative software.  At the beginning, we
give SOLVEM an initial model.  After DIAGNO, we find there are still
significant systematic residuals.  Then we try to improve our model
and input the new model constraint to SOLVEM.  This is one iteration.
FMODEL will become the most comprihensive package of FONDA.
     1. rigid translation along a fault
     2. uniform strain
     3. block rotation
     4. half-space elastic material dislocation model (from Okada)
        4.1 point source
        4.2 rectangular plane source
     5. viscoelastic coupling dislocation model (from Li & Rice)
     6. magma inclusion model (from Wahr ?)
     7. local deformation correction model (from Humphrey & Soucier)
     8. fault group interfere model (from Rundle ?)
     9. back-arc basin spreading and thermal subsidence model (?)
    10. finite element modeling (using CONMAN)

#5 Display package: (DISPLY)
     The purposes of this package are trifold:
     1. visual display
        The operator can compare the observed displacement or strain
        with the modeling results simultaneously.
        (is it possible to modidy parameter simultaneously?)
     2. print various maps for thesis, meeting and publication.
     3. commercial display:
        movie show of FONDA to the people.

#6 Optimal design package: (DESIGN)
     1. calculate the cross-correlation coefficience between models.
     2. check the separability and detectability of our models.
     3. optimal network design for accuracy and model detecting.
