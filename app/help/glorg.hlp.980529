      <com_file>     is the name of globk common file used in the analysis.


The GLORG command-file inputs are:

          APR_FILE  - GLOBK-style file of a priori station positions and
                      velocities.  **NOTE**: New a priori coordinates can be
                      used only for stations that were loosely constrained in 
                      the GLOBK analysis.  Command may be issued multiple
                      times.
          USE_SITE  - List of stations to be used in the origin definition.
                      CLEAR and ALL are acceptable site names.  The 
                      command my be invoked multiple times.
          EQUATE    - Forces adjustments to parameters to be made equal. 
                      Form is:
                       equate  n1 n2 n3 n4 ..
                      will force these to be equal.  (Numbers must be
                      in ascending order.)
                      OR
                      Site names may also be used in which case
                      the command looks like:
                       equate west_gps xdot hays_gps xdot.
                      The exceptable site name modifiers are:
                      xdot, ydot, zdot, ndot, edot, udot and
                      xpos, ypos, zpos, npos, epos, upos
                      for velocities and positions. (Local_eq
                      determines if global cartesian or local
                      coordinates will be used for equates.
                      If a site name is given which is not in the
                      solution then error messages warning about
                      decoding errors will be printed.  These may
                      be ignored.
          CONSTRA   - Similar to EQUATE except that the standard deviation
                      of the constraint is specified.  Form is:
                        constrai <sigma> n1 n2 ...
                      where sigma is in units of the parameters.
          FORCE       Will force the adjustment to a parameter
                      to a specific values.  Forms are similar
                      equate in that parameter numbers or site
                      name and component may be used:
                       force n1 value
                       force west_gps xdot value
                      where n1 is a parameter number and 
                       value is the value of the adjustment to
                      to this parameter to be forced.
    
          LOCAL_EQ  - Used in conjunction with EQUATE and FORCE.
                      Rotates the sites into NEU before applying constraint.  The
                      parameter numbers used are then the X number for N,
                      Y number for E and Z number for U.  Only
                      one setting can be used for all equates and
                      forces.  At Vers. 4.04 the default for this command
                      became to form equates in local frame.  The use of
                      of the command is now:
                       local_eq n
                      to make the equates and forces in the XYZ frame rather
                      than NEU.

Commands added at Version 3.23:  These commands may be used with all data types.

          POS_ORG   - Sets the parameters to be used in setting the
                      origin, rotation and scale of the coordinate
		      system.  Arguments are the parameters to be
		      used viz. XTRAN, YTRAN and ZTRAN for translation;
		      XROT, YROT and ZROT for rotations; and
		      SCALE for scale factor. e.g.,
		       pos_org xrot yrot zrot 
                      would only allow rotations in setting the
		      coordinate system.  Used with USE_SITE to set
		      which sites are used in the definition
          RATE_ORG  - Similar to POS_ORG but for rates.  Same arguments
		      may be used.
          CND_HGTV  - Used with pos_org and rate_org to set the variance
		      of the heights relative to a variance of 1 for the
		      horizontal components.  Setting CND_HGTV to a
		      large number, effectively elimiates heights being
		      used the coordinate system definition.  The first 
		      two values given are for position and velocity.
		      The next two values (as explained below) are for
		      the variance ratios needed for a site to be used
		      in the origin constraint.  Example:
		        cnd_hgtv 10 10 2.0 10.0		      
          FIRST_EQ  - Sets mode in which the equates and forces will be
                      applied before the origin fixing constraints (as 
                      discussed above) are appied.  No arguments.

          EQ_DIST   - Allows equates to be specified for all sites within
		      the set distance. Form is
		       eq_dist  <dist (m)> <equate type>
                      where equate type is is defined under EQUATE. e.g.,
		       eq_dist 2000 ndot
                      equates the north velocity adjustments for all sites
		      within 2 km of each other.
          UNEQUATE  - Is used to override the equates set with eq_dist. 
		      Form is same as equate, and any parameter specified
		      in the equate will be removed from the equate lists.
		       unequate gras_085 ndot gras_085 edot
		      would remove gras_085 north and east velocity parameters
		      from any from any equates in which they appeared.

          PLATE     - Allows Euler poles to estimated using a selection of
                      sites.  The velocity residuals in the glorg output are
                      then given relative to these new poles of rotation.
                      The format of the command is:
                       plate <plate name> <..list of stations ... >
                      where <plate name> is the 8 character name of the plate
                      and the list of stations is the list of site whose
                      velocities will be used to determine the Euler pole.
                      The command may be issuued multiple times with the
                      same plate name to build a complete list of sites 
                      (NOTE: A site should not be named multiple times).
                      and to specify different plates.  The estimation is
                      done for all plate simultaneously using the full
                      velocity covariance matrix.

Commands added at version 4.01 of glorg

         COND_SIG   - Sigmas to be assigned to translation, rotation, and scale
                      parameters in pos_org and rate_org commands.  Six values
                      are specified: translation sigma (m), rotation sigma (mas),
                      scale sigma (ppb), translation rate (m/yr), rotation 
                      rate (mas/yr) and scale rate (ppb/yr).  When the parameters
                      are given, the origin of the system to defined to only 
                      within these sigmas.  The command is useful for minimizing
                      numerical stability problems and/or have the site position
                      and rate sigmas account for uncertainties in realizing the 
                      reference frame.
                      e.g.  cond_sig 0.01 0.1 0.1  0.01 0.1 0.1
                      sets the origin to 10 mm, orientation to 0.1 mas, and scale
                      to 0.1 ppb, the origin rates are 10 mm/yr, 0.1 mas/yr and
                      0.1 ppb/yr.

Features added at version 4.02 of glorg  
---------------------------------------

The CND_HGTV command was modified to accept two additional arguments.  These 
optional arguments (following the two values for reweighting the height and 
height-rate variances) set limits on the sigmas of the height and height rates
of station to be used in the origin constraints.  They are meant to exclude
stations with large uncertainties and are specified in terms of heights because 
an indeterminate reference frame will cause the uncertainties of the horizontal 
coordinates to be artificially large.  Specifically, they set a limit on the
following ratio:  (h-hav)/(hav-hbest) where h is the variance of the height
or height rate of a station, hav is the average variance for all stations
used for the origin definition, and hbest is the best (smallest) variance
of the stations being used.  When translation parameters are not estimated, a 
ratio of 2 is acceptable;  when translations are estimated a value nearer
to unity is better.  By making the height velocity ratio large, the same 
sites will be used in the constaining both position and rate of the origin.
The defaults are 3.0 and 3.0 (Changed with vers 4.04)

Commands added at version 4.04 of glorg (980419)
------------------------------------------------

       STAB_ITE  - Sets characteristics of coordinate system stabalization.  
                   The command format is: 

                     stab_ite [# iterations] [Site Relative weight] [n-sigma]  

                    where [# iterations] is the number of iterations.  The
                              default is 2, which works fine in well behaved
                              cases, but the iterations are quick, so allowing
                              4, e.g., is usually safer.
                          [Site Relative weight] indicates how the site sigmas
                              are used in stabilization. If it is set to 0.0,
                              all sites are weighted equally throughout all
                              interations of the stabilization process; if set to
                              1.0, the weight is determined by the coordinate
                              sigmas in the previous iteration; if set to an 
                              intermediate value, say 0.5 (default), the coordinate
                              sigmas from the previous iteration are allowed only
                              50% weight (vs constant).  The number of iterations
                              must be > 1 for this feature to be invoked.  In
                              this computation, as in the overall stabilization,
                              heights sigmas are downweighted with respect to the 
                              horizontal sigmas by CND_HGTV (1st two arguments).
                              feature to be invoked. (default 0.5).  Note that
                          [n-sigma] is an editing condition to eliminate sites 
                              that are discordant with the aprioris.  (Iterations
                              must be greater than 1 to be used).  The value 
                              applies to the ratio of the root-sum-square of the
                              north, east, up residual (calculated with up down-
                              weighted) to the site's relative weight (displayed
                              in the output) times the overall rms of the 
                              stabilization fit (also displayed).  The default
                              is 4.0.

        STAB_MIN   - Allows user to set the minimum values for the cnd_hgtv 
                     limits on heights sigmas of sites to be used in the 
                     stabalization, and on the miniumum RMS to be used in
                     postfit rms editing.  The command format is:
             
                      stab_min [dHsig min pos] [Min RMS pos] [dHsig min rates] [Min RMS rate]

                     where [dHsig min pos] is minium difference between best and median
                          height sigma for position (default 0.005 m)
                           [Min RMS pos] is minium postfit RMS in position to be
                          used. (Default 0.003 m)
                           [dHsig min rates] is same as [dHsig min pos] except 
                          for rates (default 0.005 mm/yr)
                           [Min RMS rate] is same as [Min RMS pos] except for 
                          for rates (default 0.003 m/yr).
                     If only two arguments are given then these values will be
                     used for both position and velocity.
                     Example
                       stab_min 0.005 0.003 0.005 0.003
                     

Other changes at 4.04:
----------------------
Detection of poorly determined sites (see CND_HGTV above) was changed to be 
the deviation from the median rather than from the mean.  This makes the 
detection more sensitive and reliable in cases with poorly determined 
stations

Changed the default CND_HGTV values from 1.0 to 10.0, which is more typical 
of height variance relative to horizontal components; and changed the height 
ratio limits from 2.0 (position) and 10.0 (velocity) to 3.0 and 3.0.   In 
cases unreliable height estimates, it's advisable to downweight the heights
significantly and set the ratio large so that no site will be removed due
to a height problem, but rather all editing will be done on the 2d and 
successive iterations using the horizontal components; i.e., set 
CND_HGTV 10000. 10000. 10. 10.

Introduced separate (internal) lists for sites to be used in the position
and velocity stabilization, reflecting the result of different editing
through multiple interations.  To force the same sites to be used for both
stabilizations, you will need make sure all sites are included by setting
the two editing criteria (last two arguments of CND_HGTV and last argument
of STAB_ITE) to large values.

LOCAL_EQ was changed to take an optional N argument to force the equates
to made in an XYZ frame.  Use of NEU frame for equates and forces is now
the default.
