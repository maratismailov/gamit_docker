SWAPH: Swaps byte order in GLOBK h-file


 PROGRAM SWAPH

 Program to read a globk binary hfile and swap the byte order if necessary.
 This is to allow hfiles generated on the linux and Dec systems to used on
 the HP and Sun sytems and visa versa.  The version number of the hfile
 is used to indicate that the bytes have been swapped.

 This pogram replaces the hfile in place (i.e., the input files are overwritten
 by the program).

 Runstring
% swaph <...list of hfiles to swap bytes in ...>
