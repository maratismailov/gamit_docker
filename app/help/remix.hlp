REMIX: Remixes spectral components to new values.

Runstring:

% remix <infile> <outfile> <Df (cpd)> <cos +- sin +-> <cos +- sin +->

where infile is name of input file
	outfile is the output file name (overwritten)
	Df is frequency shift (0.070467 cpd will map 13.66 day to 365 day>
	cos +- sin +- are the fields for the remixing.  These are repeated
		for as many types of data as needed
