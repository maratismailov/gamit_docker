TGREP: Globk output version of grep

Program acts like standard grep except that the globk time
tag (solution date) is added to start of lines.

Usage:
% tgrep <string> <file>
where <string> is string to be searched for.  Blanks at end 
    of string can be forced using ^ 
      <file> name of input file.  If blank stdin is used.

<string> must occurr after the 'Solution refers to' line in the
glonk output.
