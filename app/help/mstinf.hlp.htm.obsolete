MSTINF: Merge old format station.info files

MSTINF: Program to merge station.info files using a reference station.info
        file and a list of other files to be merged.  Options exist (-u/-l)
        to limit the sites used from the reference station.info file.

Runstring:
% mstinf &LT;options&GT;

where &LT;options&GT; are:
-f &LT;file&GT;  -- Reference station.info file with definitive information
-w &LT;file&GT;  -- Name of output merged station.info
(The above two options must be given.  If only these are given, then the output
 station.info will be sorted by site names and date)

-s &LT;list of files&GT; -- Names of station.info files to be merged with reference one

* Site Selection option: NOTE when the options below are used, all sites that
* are needed and appear in the reference station.info must be included in the
* lists.  If not, they will not appear in the merged station.info.  If neither
* option is used, all sites will appear in merged station.info.
-u &LT;list of names&GT; -- Names of sites to be used from the reference station.info.
              These sites will be ignored in the merged files if they are found
              in the reference station.info
-l &LT; file&GT;         -- File constaining the names of sites to be used (same as
              -u option except input is in a file.  There is one name per line
              in the file and comment lines have a non-blank character in the
              first column

-o         -- if given will allow the file given with the -w option to overwrite an
              existing file.  (Default is for the -w file to be a new file). 
-c         -- if given will have the comment lines from the station.info files
              copied to the merged file.
