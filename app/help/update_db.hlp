UDATE_DB: VLBI program to update Data Base from KalObs file
  
   Proper runstring is: 
  
 % update_db <KalObs> <code> <History file>
  
  where <KalObs> is the name of the KalObs file from which the
  information for updating the database is to be taken (including 
  the database name), and <code> is some combination of the letters 
  
         I (update ionosphere)
         G (update number of group ambiguities) 
         P (update number of phase ambiguities) 
         E (Editing of data--Solvk edits become db interactive edits)

  and history file is a set of text lines to be added to history.
  
  The database name and version are taken from the KalObs file. 
  For example,
  
 CI> update_db k84sep24x.kal gi 
  
  tells the program to update the data base !84SEP24X (from which the 
  KalObs file K84SEP24X.KAL was read) for the ionospheric values and
  the number of group delay ambiguities.
