EXCITE_PMU: Computes polar motion/UT1 excitation values
 
EXCITE_PMU:

Program to compare tables of polar motion UT1 series.  The
runstring is:
% excite_pmu <output excite>  <in primary> <UT1_def>

where  <output excite> is the name of the excitation file
       <in primary> is the name of the file for the input
            series.  Must be uniformly spaced.
       <UT1_def> is the definition of UT1 in the input series
            (R-denoted regularized)
