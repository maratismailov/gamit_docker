               ensure a string match rather than interpretation as a test,
               which causes an error. Floyd 190118

           with arc default (Herring, 2019-10-30).

links.arc: Linked to ../tables/svnav.dat first is no local copy.  Added test if local copy.  This is to ensure sh_sp3_fit
