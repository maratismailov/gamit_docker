Release Notes for GAMIT/GLOBK 10.5 

Last updated by rwk  12 August 2014
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 10.41 consolidates incremental updates made since release 10.40 
of November 2010 and adds several new features not included in the 
incremental updates.         
                     
We have provided and will keep up-to-date, ITRF2008 coordinates
sites in prior releases of the ITRF as well as new sites that have 
been and will be added for IGS processing.  The primary file, in the 
ITRF2008 NNR frame is itrf08_comb.apr; and there are secondary files, 
itrf08_comb_[plate].apr, created by rotating this file to the frames of 
the major plates using the Euler poles estimated by  Altamimi et al. 
[J. Geophys. Res., 117, B07402, doi:10.1029/2011JB008930,2012].  (Note 
that the plate-referenced files that we created 2012-01-06 and put into 
incremental_updates/tables were based on preliminary vectors that changed 
in the final publication, so users who downloaded these should replace 
them by the current files.) These files should always be used in conjunc-
tion with the rename file itrf08_comb.eq to assure that the 8-character 
site name assigned to your data matches the coordinates for the appropri-
ate period.  See 'apr_and_eq_files.txt' in the download documentation 
directory for a complete explanation of how the combined files were 
constructed. 
                     
There are improved templates in ~/gg/tables for GLOBK runs: 
globk_comb.cmd, glorg_comb.cmd, globk_long.cmd, glorg_long.cmd.  
These reflect current best practice and take advantage of the 'option' 
feature of the globk, glorg, and sh_glred command lines so that the 
same command file can be used for both repeatabilities and velocity 
solutions without editing the file itself.  The standard southern 
California example has been reworked to use these file and should 
now be easier to execute and to use as a template for your own 
processing.  Also, there is a new detailed recipe for processing
and analyzing survey-mode (sGPS) measurements, 'sGPS_recipe.txt',
to be found in the documents directory of the download site and
also on the web as part of the presentations from the recent
workshop held at UNAVCO (Boulder13).  

The GPT/GMF models for zenith hydrostatic delay and mapping functions
have been replaced by the new GPT2 model (Lager et al., Geophys. Res.
Lett., ) which is based on a more refined numerical weather model, 
includes semi-annual as well as annual variations, has better spatial 
resolution, and accounts better for height differences through a seasonally 
dependent lapse rate.  In the new model both the ZHD and mapping funtions
are derived from a table, gpt.grid, automatically linked into the experiment
and day directories from ~/gg/tables.  If you specify GPT or GMT in
your sestbl. and have gpt.grid in ~/gg/tables, you will automatically
get GPT2 (the old GPT is invoked only if gpt.grid is missing).

GLOBK now has the ability to remove non-tidal atmospheric loading
(ATML) based on the average of the day given in the h-file.  Since
GLOBK can not yet read an grid file to apply the ATML corrections
directly, if you want to investigate their effects, the best strategy
is to apply the ATML in GAMIT and then optionally retain or
remove the corrections using the new command -appload_mod in the
GLOBK commaand file.  The preferred ATML files for GAMIT are those
that have been filtered to remove sub-daily terms (atmfilt_cm.YYYY).
In principle, the sub-daily thermal tides should be applied in GAMIT,
but none of the current models, including a time-dependent recently
developed by Ray and Ponte, has been shown to reproduce accurately
the tidal loading, so the present recommendation of the IGS for
the next reprocessing is to omit these terms.

Liz Petrie of the University of Newcastle has coded a model in ARC for 
the accelerations on the GPS satellites due to antenna radiation and 
Earth radiation.  These models are invoked by setting 'Earth radiation 
model = NCEL1', now default in the sestbl. and 'fixdrv'.  As part of 
this modification, we have reworked many of the subroutines in ARC to 
be more modular, added (backward-compatible) models to the ARC batch file, 
and coded sh_get_orbits and sh_sp3fit to read the orbital models from 
from a sestbl.  This latter change assures that the orbital models used 
for creating g- and t-files from sp3 files will be consistent with the 
models used for the data processing.  For sh_gamit processsing, the 
sestbl. in ../tables is automatically linked into the /igs directory. 
If the sestbl is absent, hard-wired models will be used.                    
       
Three model conventions have been updated to be consistent with those
used by the IGS: mean pole and short-period EOP are changed from IERS 
1996 to IERS 2010, and the gravity field from EGM96 to EGM08.  These 
changes are important for EOP estimation but have neglible effect on 
positioning.

A new script sh_plot_pos will read PBO-style pos files rather than _mb
files for plotting time series.  GLOBK now generates the 'PBO' lines
in the print files automatically (no need to use PBOP in the print options).
We have retained sh_plotcrd and the use of _mb files for this release,
but they will eventually go away.  The Python script ts_plot.py, introduced
in Release 10.40 to read pos files will also be abandoned because it required 
too many non-standard Python libraries (see below).
                                 
The new script sh_plot_elmean, together with additions to the autcln summary
files allow plotting of mean residuals over several days as a function of 
elevation angle or satellite nadir angle, providing more diagnostics for bad 
antenna models or tracking environments.  These can be used instead of or
in conjuction with the individual-day sky plots and phase vs elevation plots
produced by sh_oneway from the autcln DPH files when '-pres ELEV' specified
with sh_gamit.
                                               
Keeping an up-to-date svnav.dat and antmod.dat file is <<critical>> to 
correct processing. Failure to do so will often impose the wrong radiation-
pressure model, SV antenna offset, and yaw model on the satellite. We will
notify users any time these files are changed, but regular checking of
the incremental_updates/README file is advised. Changes since 10.40 are:
 - Launch of SV 35 (Blk IIA) as PRN 1 (date: 110606)
 - Reassignment of PRN 1 to newly launched  SV63 (Blk IIF)  (110718)
 - Reassignment of PRN 30 from SV 31  to SV 35 (both Block IIA (110816)
 - Update the maximum yaw rates for Block II and Block IIA satellites 
     using the weighted average values determined by JPL 1996-2008 (110824)
 - Reassignment of PRN 24 from SV 24 (Blk IIA) to SV 49 (Blk IIR-M)
 - Reassignment of PRN 24 from SV 49 (Blk IIR-M) to SV 32 (120315)
 - Reassignment of PRN 24 from SV 32 (Blk IIR) to SV 37 (Blk IIA) (120426)
 - Reassignment of PRN 24 from SV 37 (Blk IIA) to SV 49 (Blk IIR-M) (120806)
 - Launch of SV 65 (Blk IIF), replacing SV 49 (Blk IIR-M) as PRN 24 (121008)
 - Reassignment of PRN 27 from SV 27 (Blk IIA) to  SV 49 (Blk IIR-M) (121018)   
 - Reassignment of PRN 30 from SV 35 (Blk IIA) to SV 49 (Blk IIR-M) (130510)
 - Reassignment of PRN 27 from SV 49 (Blk IIR-M) to SV 66 (Blk IIF) (130516)

** 10.4 vs 10.35     

Introduction of  a real-time kinematic module, trackRT.  See help/trackRT.hlp
for a complete description including instructions for installation.
                     
Changes to the code and svnav.dat to use an appropriate radiation-pressure
model and antenna offset for Block IIF satellites (only PN 25 thus far).  If 
you need to combine new processing with MIT or SOPAC global h-files that used 
the old models set ' apr_svs  prn_12 100 100 100 10 10 10 0R ' to unlink the 
radiation pressure models.  Both MIT and SOPAC will rerun these days to 
remove the problem.
   
Two new programs, tscon and tsfit, are available for prototyping GLOBK solutions.
They allow you to convert PBO, REASON, and other time series to GLOBK formats and
to generate in an iterative but rapid fashion appropriate models for discontinuities 
and earthquakes in continuous time series prior to making long globk runs.  See 
Chapter 4 of the GLOBK Reference Manual and the help files for tscon and tsfit.

There is a new example, better designed for instruction on setting up
processing with new data and incorporating a multi-year solution with GLOBK.
                 
The c-file and h-file formats have changed.  C-files from prior releases
cannot be used, but the code remains compatible with older GAMIT (ascii) and
GLOBK (binary) h-files.  The impetus for this change was to better document
models used in the processing, particularly for receiver and satellite antenna
models. 

Higher-order ionospheric (HOI) corrections (2nd and 3rd order, but not
bending) are available in GAMIT, as described by Petrie et al. [J. Geophys.
Res., 115, B03417, doi:10.1029/2009jb006677, 2010].  Using these terms requires 
downloading daily IONEX files containing total electron content (TEC) at 
2-hr intervals from CODE into the [expt]/ionex directory and linking these 
into the day directory using '-ion' in the sh_gamit command file.  To apply 
the effects in processing, set  'Ion model = GMAP' and 'Mag field = ITRF11' 
in the sestbl.  See the new Chapter 8 of the GAMIT Reference Manual for
more details.  Thanks to Liz Petrie of Newcastle U (UK) for most of the work
on this, and to Andrzej Araszkiewicz the Military U of Technology (Poland) 
for important contributions.

The procedure for creating and keeping an updated station.info file has 
been better documented and enhanced by changes to sh_upd_stnfo. See the
description on p. 27 of the Introduction to GAMIT/GLOBK manual, or the
README of the new example.

GLOBK will now accept multiple eq_files, allowing you to configure separate 
files for earthquakes, breaks, and editing (_XPS, XCL).  If an eq_file entry 
uses the 'break' command rather than the 'rename' command, globk will assign 
the extent. A new RENM print option causes the full rename list to be output.  
glist now also allows for multiple eq_files, separated by colons.   
    
We are now providing in the GRIDS directory on everest.mit.edu atmospheric 
loading files that have been filtered to remove the diurnal and semi-diurnal 
thermal tides (S1, S2) using the procedure described by Tregoning and Watson 
(J. Geophys. Res., 14, B09403, doi:10.1029/2009JB006344, 2009). These can be 
used in conjunction with atl.grid (also on everest) comprising the IERS
standard S1,S2 tides (Ponte and Ray, Geophys. Res. Lett.,29, 2153, doi:10.1029/
2002GL016340, 2002) by renaming the filtered files (atmfilt_cm.YYYY) to the 
standard name for unfiltered files  (atmdisp_cm.YYYY) in gg/tables, and setting 
'Use atl.grid = Y' and  'Tides applied = 63' in the sestbl.  Based on feedback
from users, we hope to eventually discontinue distribution of the unfiltered
grids.  Note that earlier versions of the filtered files, from either ANU or
MIT, were written incorrectly; further, there was a bug in the 'model' routine
that read the sub-daily ATL from the u-file, causing the north and up components 
to be reversed.  Any use of ATL should use the new grids and Release 10.4.
  
There is a new plotting script, ts_plot.py, that reads PBO-style time-
series files (.pos), created by tscon or tssum, rather than the mb_-files 
created by ensum.  We plan to transition to the .pos format eventually since 
it is more complete and flexible, but this will happen slowly and only when 
we're sure that users can easily install all of the libraries needed to run 
ts_plot.py: Python V2.7  ( http://www.python.org/download/ ); Numpy

Changes to tsview to enhance performance when viewing and editing large
numbers of time series; recording of the reasons for edits when creating entries
for eq_files.

There are updates to autcln and solve to better handle single-frequency data.  
The default in autcln now requires the user to include 'L1only' in the autcln.cmd 
file to process single-frequency data.

Pseudorange resolution of wide-lane ambiguities (LC_AUTCLN) is now recommended 
for networks larger than 50 km and data from January 1994 (except with codeless 
receivers), the date from which  empirically determined differential code biases 
(DCB) for each SV have been determined (dcb.dat) by AIUB.  A new algorithm, implemented 
for Release 10.34, is more robust than the earlier one and gives some weight to the 
ionsophere-constrained phase WL.  The defaults controls should work well for most 
networks with recent data, but you may want to test increasing the 'ion constraint' 
value (from the default .01 to .02) under maximum ionspheric conditions (2000-2002), 
or decreasing the value (to .005) for old data under minimum ionospheric conditions 
(1994-1998).  
                               
There are now IGS RINEX files with as many as 11 obervables, requiring an
update of the code (rrxhed and rrinex in gamit/lib) and remaking the executables
with MAXOBT=11 in gamit/includes/makex.h.   IGS ANTEX files begining with 
igs05_1499.atx have more comment lines than we originally coded (50).  Set MAXTXT=1000 
in gamit/includes/dimpar.h. and remake gamit.  Prior to an October 2008 incremental 
update to 10.34, failure to make this change will result in a cryptic failure in 
suggesting a misnamed receiver or antenna.  Release 10.4 will recognize ANTEX 
Version 1.4.        

Fix a bug in time argument for GPT; affects the annual signal in heights at
the level of 0.2-1.0 mm. Thanks to Francois Fund (ESGT) for catching this
and Paul Tregoning (ANU) for testing it.  
      
Fix bugs and deficiencies in sh_upd_stnfo/mstinf to obtain a better match
of entries with RINEX files and to avoid multiple entries continuous
stations when not needed.  Add the ability to get a station list from 
sites.defaults and/or the /rinex directory, and the ability to use wildcards 
to get multiple IGS log files.  Fix bug in distinguishing between Receiver Type' 
and 'Receiver SN', and 'Antenna Type' and 'Antenna SN' in reading station.info
files (thanks to Olivier Charade (INSU/CNRS), allow more complete updating
of station.info entries mid-session.

Fix two bugs in fixdrv, both introduced in 10.35:  1) full-solution 
observable erroneously set when quick_pre observable = LC (allowed for 
backward compatibility) rather than LC_ONLY (preferred); 2) check on
too-tight a priori coordinate constraints failed in sh_sigelv.  Thanks
to Liz Petrie (Newcastle) for catching both of these.  
      
Fix bug in sh_get_nav when the day number has leading zeroes, needed for
CDDIS downloads with tscsh (one line of code missed in fixes applied to 
most scripts for 10.35 release).  Thanks to S Shimada of NIED for the 
catch and Mark Murray for additional cleanup.  

Fix bug in  kf/glfor/get_max_glbd.f that resulted in wrong dimension for
the partial derivative array when earthquakes logs and/or apr_rot commands
used.  
        
Updates to 'track' to account for millisecond range jumps.

Fix bug in creating station.info entries with sh_upd_stnfo when the compiler
option for floating point is not real*8.  Thanks to Mark Murray (New Mexico 
Tech) for catching this. 
       
Fix bug in utility org2stab to get a stablization list from a velocity
solution.
          
Fix bug in sorting median process-noise values in sh_gen_stats.
      
Correct a bug in sh_update_eop after detecting an invalid EOP series.

Fix failure to link binary for utility ne2azel
 
Add gradients to the output file of sh_metutil; trap an empty z-file from 
having no good observations at a site. Copy gamit/utils/metutil.  Thanks
to Mark Murray (New Mexico Tech).

Modify sh_get_met to work with either Z or gz files, and for multiple days;
update the met directories for CDDIS.  Thanks to Kalev Rannat (Tallin U). 

Add ~60 receivers and ~10 antennas to rcvant.dat. Update to current
IGS ANTEX file (igs05_1597.atx) and create igs05_1597_plus.atx by
adding PCV models from NGS for 8 antennas not in the IGS file. 
Correct misspellings or official changes for 6 receivers or antennas.   

Changes to unimake and Makefile.config to facilitate installation under 
CYGWIN.  See the notes 'CYGWIN' under updates/documentation.  Thanks to 
Semi Ergintav (TUBITAK) and George Vergos (AUTH) for notes and testing.  

Add to sh_gamit the ability to invoke sh_metutil to get ZWD and PW (met-file)
from an input z-file and o-file, and to archive, compress, or delete z-
and met-files at the end of the run.  Add script sh_met2pbo to concatenate
multiple met-files. 

Fix header entries and format in writing SP3-C files.

Update Hatanaka RINEX compression routines to version 4.0.4, fixing function
name conflict with getline in gcc 4.4 and cleaning handling of line-feed at
end of file.  
                             
Add output lines in Euler-pole utility conveuler.
      
Modify format in utility confpol to convert N,E sigmas and correlations 
to confidence ellipses.

New utility check_siteid to compare 4-character IDs from glist and
several external formats to detect conflicts. 
        
Fix bug in reading number of data types in simulation model.

Fix compiler flags for Intel 9.0. 

Fix minor compile errors      


** 10.35 vs 10.34     
         
sh_gamit (and sh_get_orbits) allow the use of MIT orbits from global reprocessing 
2000-present, typically a factor of two better than the operational IGS Final 
orbits prior to 2004 and without the scale discontinuity at Week 1400 (November 
2006); see http://kg4-dmz.gfz-potsdam.de/igsacc/repro/igsacc_final.html.  

sh_glred (and sh_get_hfiles) allow the use of combined binary h-files from MIT 
or SOPAC reprocessing. The options for SOPAC sub-network ascii h-files now include 
'igsall' which will fetch all of the global sub-nets available on the day. (Note 
that it is not legitimate to use only a subset of the igs? h-files.)  See the 
revised Chapter 4 of 'Introduction to GAMIT/GLOBK' and the presentation 
'Reference_Frames.ppt' from the March09 Advanced Workshops on the GAMIT/GLOBK 
documentation web page for a discussion of strategies for establishing the 
reference frame for time series and velocity solutions.     

Allow for 10 or more observables in a RINEX file. 

New versions of tsch now enforce a standard (apparently always present)
that numbers with leading zeroes are treated as octal.  This causes
problems with GAMIT day number lower than 100 in a dozen shell scripts.
 
Updates to 'track' to better handle short broadacast empheris and to
resolve some issues with independent bias flags.

Using broadcast ephemeris in processing:  Update sh_bcfit to check
for validity of dates and to generate a session.info file if it does
not exist.  
         
New sh_gamit option to block updating of experiment l-file (useful to
avoid clashes when running in a cluster environment).
          
New utility (org2stab) for an generating unweight list for hfupd and a
stab_site list for glorg from a globk/glorg velocity solution.  

New utility (grw) for generating quickly sig_neu downweight commands
while viewing a time series. 
   
Change directory structure for SOPAC h-files and OLG RINEX files, and add 
BKG met files to tables/ftp_info. 
    
Changes to sh_gamit make the downloading and use of orbit files and 
IONEX files more robust.

CVIEW: Fix bug in reading in x-files; fix bug in screen display with 
OSX and some other laptops.
       
Fix bug in sh_gamit when using IGS ultra-rapid orbits.         

Fix bug iin identifying l-file coordinates to update when the site is
fast-moving (e.g. on ice). 
  
Fix bug in sh_org2vel when plate name > 7 characters.
    
Fix bug in sh_oneway for GMT formating

Fix bug in creating x-files with Topcon firmware > 3.0.
             
Fix bug in assignment of number of zenith or gradient parameters from an 
input interval (one too few in recent releases). Thanks to Ian Thomas of 
Newcastle for the catch. 

Fix bug in sh_sp3fit, which incorrectly used IGS92 rather than EGM96
gravity field for the final t-file. 

New 'fixdrv' option: Allow skipping of the loose solution ('skip loose = y') to
avoid poorly conditioned matrix with very short baselines.
                     
Allow of VMF1 ZHD with GMF; works now if UFL first 'met source' option and 
either map.grid or map.list is present.
        
Fix bug in reading ANTEX files with more than 50 comments. 

The command-line coordinate conversion program (a replacement for
'tform' in most cases) has been updated to output longitudes as either 
-180 to +180 or 0 to 360 and to fix a bug in outputting spherical l-files. 

Add to sh_gamit summary the names of sites removed from processing by the
minxf control in processing.defaults.
                                                             
Cleanup of 'solve': changes in the information written to the q-file by,
remove some screen print;  initialize 'avgload' variable; remove obsolete 
single-difference code. 
        
Add site code to error messages in reading ANTEX files      
  
Support 'gz' with Hatanaka-compressed RINEX files.
 
tables: Updates to svnav.dat and antmod.dat for SV49/PN01; it is essential
to make this update for data acquired after the launch (March 2009).
Add luni-solar tables for 2009. 

New receivers: NOV4G2 (NOV OEM4-G2), LC123G (LEICA GX1230GG), 
LC902G (LEICA GMX902GG), LC1220 (LEICA GX1220), SEPX2E (SEPT POLARX2E), 
SEPX2C (SEPT POLARX2C), SEPAX1 (SEPT ASTERX1) SEPAX2 (SEPT ASTERX2),
ALTPS3 (ALTUS APS-3), LEICA GRX1200+, LEICA GRX1200+GNSS, LEICA GX1210, 
LEICA GX1210+, LEICA GX1220+, LEICA GX1230+, LEICA GX1220+GNSS, LEICA GX1230+GNSS, 
NOVV3R (NOV OEMV3-RT2)

New Antennas: TPSG3A (TPSG3_A1),TR5980 (TRM59800.00), SOKGSR (SOK_GSR2700ISX), 
AER167 (AERAT1675_29, NOV702 (NOV702), LEICA AX1201, LEIAX1203+GNSS, LEIATX1230+GNSS,
SEP220 (SEP_POLANT+), SEP29S (EP_POLANT+_GG), TRMZGS (TRM57971.00). Correct typos 
in TOP72110 and SOK_RADIAN_IS entries.


** 10.34 vs 10.33  
   
sh_gamit (and sh_get_orbits) allow the use of IGS ultra-rapid orbits that 
include predictions, facilitating near-realtime generating of coordinates 
or atmospheric parameters.

Fix a serious bug in 'model' whereby the  pole tide, if requested, was  returned 
as zero or undefined.  The effect is up to 2 mm in horizontal and 5 mm in heights 
for a global solution, less than 1 mm horizontal for interstation differences up 
several thousand km.  The problem is avoided if you omit the pole tide in GAMIT and 
set 'app_ptid all' in GLOBK. (You cannot simply set the control in GLOBK because 
GLOBK will not apply the tide if the h-file indicates that it has been applied in GAMIT.) 
 
tables: Fix error in svnav.dat in setting start dates for PN29/SV57 and
PN07/SV48, both erroneously set for 2007 10 20 instead of their actual
launch dates.  There is no problem with the PN29 error since the previous
SV having this PN was dead by 2007 10 20 (day 293), but for PN07, using
the old files will result in errors for the period between day 293 and
the demise of the old PN07 on day 345.  Thanks to Sigrun Hreinsdottir 
of U. Arizona for catching this. 
              
Add percentage of ambiguities resolved to sh_gamit summary file 

New receivers:  SOK GSR2600, JPS EGGDT, SEPT POLARX2E, TPSHIPER_LITE
                TPS-HIPER-GGD (same as TPS HIPER-GD).
New antennas:   Micropulse WAAS 2225NW, TRM41249USCG; fix name of TPSCR.G3 to
                conform with IGS standard.  Correct SLAGP to SLHGP for ASH700228A,B,C
                in hi.dat.
               
Handle correctly site renames--either explicit for instrument changes or implicit
for earthquakes---within a session ('model'):  use only data from the longer of
the two spans.  
      
There is a new coordinate-conversion utility 'convertc' which will take as
input a GLOBK apr-file (Cartesian) or a GLOBK velocity file or glist file 
(geodetic), and output an apr-file, velocity file, or KML file (for Google
Earth).  

of the functions formerly performed by tform; 
Track: Fixes for milli-second clock resets that are not correctly accounted
for in the RINEX files.  Small bug fixes and some format changes. Increased size
to allow 12-hrs of 2-Hz data.  

Plate-referenced apr file for ITRF 2005:  The files distributed with 10.33
were in error, having used the TIRF 2000 poles to rotate itrf05.apr to
the major plates rather than the new poles from Altamimi et al. [2007].
The new files are correct, and also have site extents (_1Ps, 2PS, etc)
corresponding to the GLOBK convention used in itrf05.apr and corresponding
to the names used in itrf05.eq_rename.  Corrected versions of itrf05_aust.apr, 
itrf05_pcfc.apr, itrf05_soam.apr, itrf_noam,apr, itrf05_eura.apr, and itrf_anta.apr.  

Updated algoritm for clock estimation in 'autcln'.  

Fix bug in setting DCBs for non-Trimble receivers when AS off. Occured only 
prior to DCB availability, so no effect except a rare * printed in x-file.  
                                                                   
Wild cards now allowed for all GLOBK commands.

Fix bug in making sky plots with sh_gamit.

New feature in sh_plotcrd to select stations by region.

Fix bug in locating RINEX and h-files on the local file system.      

Increase the dimensions of MAXCHN to account for receivers with more than 20 channels.

Change in Apr., Unc., and Int. formats of globk/glorg print files to allow
velocities of -999.99 m/yr (motion on ice).

Fix a problem reading an integer elevation cutoff from the sestbl (should
be used only with LC_HELP). Thanks to Rossana deMarco of CNR-IRPI. 

ZHD in 'model':  There is a bug that causes a fatal when RNX UFL is the met 
heirarchy and the RINEX values are bogus.  The bug is complicated by the 
presence of a redundant and unused file in the distribution.  To fix the 
problem, copy /gamit/model/get_met_source.f and Makefile.generic, remove 
from your /gamit/model directory the file get_ion_source.f, Makefile, and 
model_lib.a; then regenerate the Makefile (unimake -m model from the /gamit level) 
and remake model. Thanks to Liz Petrie at U Newcastle for catching this. 
             
'yawtab':  Fix bug in call to oversn.f, effect is only to miss version numbers.

Mac OSX Intel: Fix inadvertent carriage return in /libraries/Makefile.config.
 

** 10.33 vs 10.32
      
Update svnav.dat and antmod.dat (igs05_1461.atx) for SV55/PN15 (25 Oct 2007)
and SV57/PN29 (21 Dec 2007).
                           
Lunisolar tables for 2008; IAU 1980 nutations replaced by IAU 2000 nutations. 
H-files created with the old model will be automatically rotated to the new
model.  

sestbl:  Change 'Antenna model' to AZEL and 'SV antenna model' to ELEV to use 
absolute PCVs;

sittbl: Loosen suggested constraints to relect preference for ambiguity resolution.
              
Fix bug for OTL interpolation for sites between 0 longitude and the first grid 
point (0.25 deg for FES2004, 0.5 deg for other grids).  1
             
Fix bug in reading and using ATML or VMF1 values on the last day of the year.

New receivers: LEICA GRX1200GGPRO, TPS NETG3, TPS MAXOR, TPS EUROCARD,  NOV OEMV3    
New antennas:  LEIAT504GG, TRM4600, TRM41249USCG, NOV702GG, NOV702GL, NOV702 rev.4
     
Replace 'compress' but 'gzip' in scripts.   

Velocity histograms (sh_velhist):  Add capability to set a minimum as well as maximum 
sigma and a geographicbox.  

Enhancements to facility cluster computer: In /com,  sh_PBS_gamit, sh_gamit, sh_sp3fit, 
sh_get_orbits.

Add worst, best, median in calculating random walk for'real sigma' algorithm in
sh_gen_stats, sh_enstat: 

guess_rcvant.dat: Added missing carats (^) to entries for the TOPCON/TPS
receivers and antennas. 
                           
TRACK: Fixed 10-hz epoch problem and reading gamit zenith delay estimates.

sh_sp3fit:  Fix bug reading sp3c files (old code wrong but works ok with 
g77 but not gfortran). Thanks to Demitry Balandin (Inst Geophysics Urals, RAS) 
for finding this. 

Fix bug with merging station.info files (sh_upd_stnfo, mstinf2).  

New RINEX compresssion routines provided by Yuki Hatanaka (GSI-Tsukuba) to 
handle RINEX Version 3.0. 

Fix header comments for sh_metutil (correct units for temperature and ZHD).

Using Az-El PCV corrections:  There was an error in interpolating the 
ANTEX tables when both elevation- and azimuth-dependent corrections are
used.  On rare occasions, depending on the details of the model and 
distribution of observations, the bug could generate up to 10 mm error 
in heights and zenith delays, though usually the effect is negligible.   
Thanks to Wang Min of CEA for the catch.

Using GPT for a priori pressure and temperature.  There was a bug in the
time argument used to read the GPT model; the change in values, however, is 
very small and has a negigible effect on estimates of heights or zenith delays.
Copy gamit/model/atmdel.f.  Thanks to Peter Smythe of ANU for the catch. 

Fixed problem with converting mutiple SINEX files with htoglb.

sh_rx2apr (svpos); Fix problem using RINEX Version 1 (missing 'G' for SV name).  

Change to autcln to improve postfit editing for old data. 

Change the default gravity field for 'arc' to EGM96' (fixdrv).

Add gravity and nutation models to the h-file.                

Fix bug in 'xtorx' with new-format station.info.


** 10.32 vs 10.31  

Installation: 1) For the Intel compiler the link for libraries/comlib/execute_intel.f 
should point to execute_hp.f, not exectute_g77.f;  2) for OSX 8.8, Makefile.config
updated to read 'OS_ID Darwin 5200 8800';  3) for gfortran, restore a missing link 
for  csubs.f in gamit/clean. 

Ambiguity resolution with LC_AUTCLN:  changes in autcln will improve resolution of 
WLs signficantly, both before and after the introduction of DCBs (April 2001).  
Changes in solve will reduce or eliminate cases of failed inversions due to problems 
removing dependent biases.

Ambiguity resolution with LC_HELP:  WL resolution in the presence of high ionosphere is 
improved by rescaling the WL bias sigmas by the rms deviations for each baseline rather 
than by the overall nrms of the ionosphere-constrained solution.  
                                                       
Narrow-lane ambiguity resolution :  With both LC_AUTCLN and LC_HELP, deviation-scaling 
of the NL sigmas is also implemented.  The effect on resolution is not large, but 
the statistical summaries now printed in the q-file provide useful diagnostics for 
tuning ambuiguity resolution. (Changes also to sh_gamit to pick up the new print
for the mailto summary file.
                  
VMF1:  Changes to allow multiple formats of VMF1 station-list files.  

autcln.cmd: The template gg/tables had an extraneous blank before 'POST lc_autcln'
that should be removed to use LC_AUTCLN in GAMIT.  

METUTIL:  Fix two bugs using RINEX met files: 1) add correctly an extra value
at the end to allow proper interpolation; 2) change temperature units to K.
Copy gamit/utils/metutil.f.     

Ashtech choke ring antennas:  Bug in setting the aliases for these antennas for purposes
of calculating direct height from slant height, results in a direct height error of
about 1 mm for an antenna mounted 1 m above the mark.  

New receviers:  Added Leica GMX902 and Trimble R7 and R8.
                                                            
Creating new-style station.info:  Add self-documentation for program gamit/hi/conv_stnfo)
that converts an old-style to new-style station.info file.  

sh_plotvel: Better diagnostics. 
            
RINEX compression:  Change sh_get_rinex to use sh_crx2rnx instead of sh_uncompress,
and sh_uncomopress to use gunzip instead of uncompress.     

GLORG: Output option (MIDP) which references solutions to the midpoint epoch of the
combined data; should not be used when large stochastic position estimates are present.


** 10.31 vs 10.30         

hi.dat:  The ASHDMG antennas was misnamed ASHGD3; fixed errors in slant range dimensions 
for the ASHDMG, ROGSNR, and ROGRMA antennas.  None of these errors will affect runs
with DHARP as the height measurement.

Atmospheric delay models:  Fixed bug in GPT; made reading of a RINEX met file or a
u-file ZHD (VMF1) more robust.  

Met utilities:  Fixed problem with RINEX met files and improved interpolation for
sh_met_util. 

gcc/g77  3.4.x bug:  Added a temporary patch to a lapack routine causing 'solve' to
stall in an infinite loop when compiled with level 3 optimization with gcc/g77 3.4.x
and possibly 2.95. 

kf/track : Fixed problem reading RX files with internal comments with more than 12 lines
           rd_rinex_obs.f. 

Deleting eclipse data:  Has not worked properly for some time, but now fixed
in gamit/utils/autecl.f.  

Problems compiling and using ocean loading with the HP f90 compiler..  Download the entire 
incrementals to get Makefile changes, system-dependent routines, and several GAMIT routines 
with uninitialized variables.   
   
Initialization problem for 'idatum' in fixdrv.  

Sky plots not created by sh_gamit because sh_make_sky_gifs looks for 'autcln postfit'
in the sestbl, but this command is no longer necessary; fixed sh_make_sky_gifs.

Fix intel compiler flags for 'solve'.  Thanks to S. Shimada (NIED/Tsukuba) for catching this.

SV-dependent data reweighting did not work with (default) 'AUTCLN Postfit = R' option.
Copy gamit/fixdrv/bmake.f. Thanks to Wang Min (CEA/Beijing) for catching this. 

Add traps for # SVs on g-file or nav-file > maxsat.  Copy gamit/fixdrv/satnmr.f and
gamit/makexp/checke.f  
           
hi.dat: Correct entries for SLBCR for ROGSNR and ROGRMA.  Thanks to Sigrun Hreinsdottir
of U. Arizona for catching this.  

OS-dependent routine for HP:  The HP requires a special version of libraries/comlib/systime.f 
so so we have re-introduced OS-dependent versions; also we need an HP version of
kf/gen_util/execute.f.  Copy cversn.f, Makefile.generic, and the systime_HHH.f version 
you need from /libraries/comlib; and Makefile.generic and the execute_HHH.f version
you need from kf/gen_util. 
 
MAKEX problem opening and closing hi.dat.  Copy makex.f and closem.f from gamit/makex.

svnav.dat:  Update for PN12/SV58.  Copy svnav.dat or svnav.dat.igs, depending
on whether you want to maintain backward-compatibility or IGS-consistency for SV
antenna offsets when using a relative PCVs (with absolute PCVs, these values are
overridden by antmod.dat).  Note that SOPAC used an old svnav.dat for processing
of PRN 12 between 2006 12 15 and 2007 01 13, so if you are combining SOPAC H-files
with your own processing, you must either exclude PRN 12 from your processing or
allow the radiation-pressure parameters to adjust independently in the SOPAC and your
own h-files.  This is easily accomplish by  'apr_svs  prn_12 100 100 100 10 10 10 0R'.
As described in the 10.2 Release Notes, a similar situation pertains to PN22/SV22
as a result our error in listing its block number. Its radiation pressure parameters
should be decoupled from all SOPAC or MIT H-files created between 1993 and 2003. 

GLORG: Fixed I*8 declaration for memory allocation on 64-bit machines when plate estimate
used. 

HTOGLB: Sinex routines changed to read and deconstrain center of mass and satellite anttena
offset estimates.  Added codes for IGS05_1404 antmod file to SMod_to_full.f. 
 
sh_rx2apr: svpos/svdiff now work properly with the C2 observable.

Apriori coordinates:  GAMIT/model now has the ability to use the full 8-character
station name when reading a GLOBK-style L-file together with a GLOBK eq_file.
The link scripts will now attempt to link into the day directory, via the 
[expt]/tables directory a file named 'eq_rename', which you may link (in [expt]/tables
or gg/tables to a particular rename file.  In the gg/tables directory distributed with
10.31, theeq_rename file is linked to a file derived from the steps documented for
IGS stations by IGS Analysis Center Coordinator Remi Ferland (NRCan) and distributed as
IGS-Discontinuities.snx.  This file is incomplete even for IGS stations but may serve
as a starting point for GAMIT users.

Trapping bad a priori coordinates:  If you overconstrain a station's coordinates
in the GAMIT run, you will get an elevated nrms and degraded ambiguity resolution.
There is now a test for this in 'solve', based on an adjustment more than twice
the apiori constraint.  The script sh_sigelv in the batch file now checks for
the requisite lines in the q-file, and if a station has a large adjustment in
the first ('p') solution, its constraints are relaxed for the final ('a') solution.

N-file reweighting: Because the N-file is now always written (for trapping 
bad a priori coordinates), the sestbl command for invoking phase-error reweighting
is changed from 'Use N-file = Y' to 'AUTCLN reweight = Y'.  However, the old
command will still work in 10.31.


** 10.30 vs 10.21 

Speed of computation:  New inversion routines have been added to SOLVE, 
improving the speed by about 30%.  Note that gfortran will gain another
10% compared to g77, and the Intel compiler about 25%.  

sh_gamit.log:  All of the GAMIT batch file status, warning, and fatal
messages are now written into the log file, and more traps have been
added to stop the run once a fatal is encountered. This should make it
easier to find the source of a failure.

Fix logic to 'cfmrg' and 'solve'  to allow more than 30 SVs.  This change is 
necessary if you use the full complement of SVs currently distributed
with IGS orbits.
     
Fix sh_gamit problem resulting in deleted rinex files when making Hatanaka 
compressed RINEX at the end of the run.  Copy /com/sh_gamit. 

Add aliases for JNS versions of Topcon 'zero-centered' antennas.  Copy
gamit/lib/ant_alias.f. 
                
AUTCLN: Fixed problem with postfit editing bias flags, added additional
calls to trim one way to remove bad data and fixed P1/P2 residual output,
and changed default # of channels from 14 to 15 to accommadate newer
receivers (also fixable by setting 'max_chan 15' in autcln.cmd.)

MAKEXP: Fixed problem when a station.info entry begins later than the session 
start and on a separate day.  Avoid problem when station.info has no entry 
for data in a RINEX file linked into the day directory but not used in 
the session: rstnfo now prints only a warning if called by makexp; if there 
is a true omission, makex will stop with a fatal.  

SOLVE: Fixed bug in printing observable/ambiguity type in q-file,  Fix bugs
when estimating a single zenith delay.  Fix bug (introduced with incrementals
of 060227) in assigning gradient apr values; thanks to Sunil Bisnath of CfA
and Mathilde Vergnolle of U. Luxembourg. Fix a bug in reading the batch file 
and writing the q-file header when there are more than 50 sites; thanks to
Kirill Palamartchouk of TU Crete.

GLORG: Added eq_dist option for estimates of logarithmic parameters; fix
some bugs in earthquake reporting.                             

Plotting time series:  The new print option PBOP in glorg will generate output
lines in the format adopted by the U.S. Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO); plots
are generated by new program tssum.  
         
GLBTOSNX: Improved output of renamed sites.

Allow true C2 observables by not changing 'C2' to 'P2' unless the data 
are earlier than 2004 (needed for Trimble serial P-code data).  

sh_merge_rinex: Now allows input of the sampling intervel.  Thanks
to Seiichi Shimada of NIED for the fix.  

sh_make_rinex: The script to run to run TEQC on raw data files to create 
RINEX had a bug that prevented mixing of Trimble data files with those from 
any other receiver type; now fixed.

SP3-C files:  Fix option (-u) in sh_sp3fit for excluding SVs, thanks to 
Wang Min of CEA Beijing.  Fix problems when flags are needed, thanks 
to  Mark Murray of New Mexico Tech.  Fix bug in naming g-file with 
2- or 3-day fits. 

PCV models: Updated versions of the IGS01 relative and IGS05 absolute PCV models
in gg/tables: igs_01_antex11.pcv and igs_05.atx.  The igs_05.atx file has a 
model for the new PRN 17 (SVN 53) as well as revisions of additions for about 
50 ground antennas.

TRACK: Updated to handle sp3c format and new IIRM satellites; small changes
to better handle bad pseudorange data.

Fix non-working -u option (exclude SVs with unknown accuracy code) in sh_sp3fit. 
Thanks to Wang Min of CEA for the catch.  McClusky 060306

Missing data from Leica GRX1200:  Fix omission of SVs in upper channels when 
an incorrect firmware version is used in station.info; thanks to Wang Min of
CEA Beijing.  

sh_baseline:  Allow turning off of error bars and setting the tick and labels 
of the y-axis. 
 
sh_upd_stnfo: Fixed bug in updating station.info from a RINEX file when more
than 12 SVs listed in an epoch line; thanks to A. Zubovitch of RAS Moscow.
 
Bogus antenna heights: Fix bug that set HI=0. when using hi.dat with a missing 
height code. 

unify_apr:  Better handling of sites when they appear multiple times in pos_mode
and vel_mode.

merge_apr: New program to merge two a priori files with no duplicate entries.

Fix non-POSIX standard calls to 'head' and 'tail' command in > 100  scripts
(old form does not work with Fedora Core 5). 

Use gzip/gunzip instead of compress/uncompress in locating and creating
RINEX files. (Still more scripts to change for this.)  Copy from /com:
sh_find_data and sh_make_rinex.
