*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  user-replaceable support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     IY       i     UTC:  year (Notes 1 and 2)
*     IM       i           month (Note 2)
*     ID       i           day (Notes 2 and 3)
*     FD       d           fraction of day (Note 4)
*
*  Returned:
*     DELTAT   d     TAI minus UTC, seconds
*     J        i     status (Note 5):
*                       1 = dubious year (Note 1)
*                       0 = OK
*                      -1 = bad year
*                      -2 = bad month
*                      -3 = bad day (Note 3)
*                      -4 = bad fraction (Note 4)
*                      -5 = internal error (Note 5)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and it is improper
*     to call the routine with an earlier date.  If this is attempted,
*     zero is returned together with a warning status.
*
*     Because leap seconds cannot, in principle, be predicted in
*     advance, a reliable check for dates beyond the valid range is
*     impossible.  To guard against gross errors, a year five or more
*     after the release year of the present routine (see parameter IYV)
*     is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is returned
*     but the result is computed in the normal way.
*
*     For both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is J=+1.
*     This is distinct from the error status J=-1, which signifies a
*     year so early that JD could not be computed.
*
*  2) If the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second,
*     the TAI-UTC value returned is for the period leading up to the
*     leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap
*     second ends, the TAI-UTC returned is for the period following the
*     leap second.
*
*  3) The day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example
*     1 through 30 for April.  The "almanac" convention of allowing
*     such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this
*     routine, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.
*
*  4) The fraction of day is used only for dates before the introduction
*     of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the end of 1971.
*     It is tested for validity (0 to 1 is the valid range) even if not
*     used;  if invalid, zero is used and status J=-4 is returned.  For
*     many applications, setting FD to zero is acceptable;  the
*     resulting error is always less than 3 ms (and occurs only
*     pre-1972).
*
*  5) The status value returned in the case where there are multiple
*     errors refers to the first error detected.  For example, if the
*     month and day are 13 and 32 respectively, J=-2 (bad month) will be
*     returned.  The "internal error" status refers to a case that is
*     impossible but causes some compilers to issue a warning.
*
*  6) In cases where a valid result is not available, zero is returned.
*
*  References:
*
*  1) For dates from 1961 January 1 onwards, the expressions from the
*     file ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat are used.
*
*  2) The 5ms timestep at 1961 January 1 is taken from 2.58.1 (p87) of
*     the 1992 Explanatory Supplement.

*     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
*     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
*     with the following requirements:
*
*     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
*        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from

*        locally supported mechanisms for keeping track of leap
*        seconds, perhaps file or network based.  It avoids the need for
*        applications to be relinked periodically in order to pick up

*        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
*        thereof such as changes of case.
*
*     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
*        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
*        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
*        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
*
*     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
*        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
*        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
*        derived work.
*
*     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
*     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
*     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
*     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
*     such, as explained above.
*
*  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
*     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
*     by inappropriate modification.
*
*  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
